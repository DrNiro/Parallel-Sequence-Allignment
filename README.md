# Parallel-Sequence-Allignment

Sequence-Allignment - A way to estimate a similarity of two strings of letters.

Each letter in the sequence might represents DNA, RNA, or protein. Identification of region of similarity of set of Sequences is extremely time consuming. This project deals with a simplified version of Sequence Alignment of two sequences. 

The purpose of the project is to parallelize the basic algorithm to produce an efficient computations within MPI and OpenMP environment.
